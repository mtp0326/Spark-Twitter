1. Brief summary of what your project does
  Similar to twitter, users are able to sign in by completing the signup page with their first and last name, username, password birthday, and any profile pic they want to use. For security, the password is encrypted with SHA256. In the homepage, users can see all posts of their own and the accounts they follow in chronological order. The user can also like and comment on these posts. Users can also post their own tweet, which will appear in both their homepage and profile. The profile page has the searched username's or the user's own information along with their own posts. Users also have the choice to follow or unfollow the searched users. The hashtag search bar gives all the posts associated with the searched hashtag. You can also edit your profile in the edit page. All the features are also mobile responding.

2. Which features you chose to include
  Node.js for the backend through using routes.js and database.js. I used AWS DynamoDB for the database. For SHA256 encryption, I used the Stanford Javascript Crypto Library. In the frontend, I used embedded javascript that includes javascript HTML and CSS.

3. How much time you spent developing this project
  8 hours

4. What features you werenâ€™t able to complete and how you would complete them
  None that was required or recommended. To add to the project, I wanted to allow users to upload pictures or videos to their posts, which could have been done by storing and calling the large files through AWS S3.
